# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Testing a variety of methods to achieve high precision and recall on a highly imbalanced dataset (99.83% / 0.17%))

All of the code is in the .ipynb file.

Following the general framework proposed by [in this article](https://machinelearningmastery.com/framework-for-imbalanced-classification-projects/) for imbalanced data, using [this kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/). Then, used [this example](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shivamb/semi-supervised-classification-using-autoencoders) to guide my own implementation of autoencoding for data preprocessing.


**Here is the overall organization in this code:**

1. EDA
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Spot Checking Classic Algorithms
4. Spot Checking Imbalance Algorithms (Over&Under sampling)
5. Cost Sensitive Algorithms
6. One-Class Algorithms
7. Probablity Tuning Algorithms
8. Hyperparameter Tuning Best Results
9. Keras Functional API Auto-encoder
